# Java to Kotlin - Examples on what makes Kotlin the better language

Duncan McGregor and Nat Pryce wrote an amazing book that every Java developer should read: [Java to Kotlin - A Refactoring Guidebook](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58153478-java-to-kotlin)

Duncan McGregor also has a nice series of [accompanying video's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFCLXKDeAnY&list=PL1ssMPpyqochwd6i5EgLhsY22yK_4Qnhb) which I can highly recommend.
