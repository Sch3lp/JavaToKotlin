This is a typical layered architecture for a book library.

It starts with a "Controller" that a client would typically use to try and lend a book that they're interested in, all they need is an ISBN.

Your job is to find the bugs in the java code.

There's one in Controller, which is not obvious if you look at the contracts (signatures) of the methods.
When you find it, think about the originating place of the bug and how you could avoid it.

There's another one in Book, which is also not very obvious without Unit Tests (these are left out on purpose).

There's yet another one in Validation, but it won't cause a lot of issues.
You'll just have to start debugging once some field is actually invalid at runtime,
and you made a mistake in the usage of the Validation utility functions...
